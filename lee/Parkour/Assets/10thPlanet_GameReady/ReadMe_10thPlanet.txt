10th Planet Info:

- Watch the Watch Me video for a view of how the animations and environment pieces can fit togehter.
- Play all animations at 12 frames per second.4
- A separate shadow has been provided for the character, it should shrink and grow as the character moves, please references the WATCH ME video to see how I would do it.
- Characters run animation can start as low as 10fps and increase as high as 24fps as the level begins to move more quickly.
- Please reference all "SAMPLE" images and videos for correct positioning and location of the rendered objects given.
- A simple Unity particle effect using the color of the object collected or the hazard collided with should be enough to sell contact between the character and objects in the world.
- The font used has also been supplied, please reference the "SAMPLES" given for proper font sizes.
- The Light is a warning system for the gun, so the player can expect a coming shot, they then have to react to whether its shooting high or low to jump out of the way. Gun can come from floor or ceiling.
- The lazers force the player to jump or not jump, the single animation provided is perfect for the lowest lazer, but can be rotated upwards slightly on its origin point to give the illusion of
  adjustment to the perspective.
- After going through a doorway the entire environment will be flipped, this will help give the illusion of a new area using the same art. 
- The space background from the Main Menu can also be used in game to go behind the windows.
